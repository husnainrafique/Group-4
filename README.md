## Description 
> The **HandMeDowns** App is a platform designed to facilitate the exchange of books 
within a local community, particularly targeting students. Instead of relying upon money, users can 
trade books with one another. This approach aims to increase reusability of resources, 
especially for students at the end of their semesters when they no longer need their textbooks. 
The goal and motivation behind this project are: to support the local community by making books 
more accessible and promoting sustainable practices through book exchanges.
> In addition to trading, users can also choose to donate books or sell them. If a book is sold,
 a certain percentage of the sale amount will be contributed to local community help initiatives.
