## Description 
> The Local Book Trade Center is a platform designed to facilitate the exchange of books 
within a local community,particularly targeting students. Instead of using money, users can 
trade books with one another. This approach aims to increase access to a variety of books, 
especially for students at the end of their semesters when they no longer need their textbooks. 
The goal and motivation behind this project are to support the local community by making books 
more accessible and promoting sustainable practices through book trading.
